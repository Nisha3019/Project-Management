# Project-Management - JPace Construction Project - Case Analysis

**Overview**
  - This repository contains an analysis of the JPace Construction Company Case, which involves building a 30,000-seat soccer stadium in Greensboro, NC under strict deadlines and potential risks such as labor strikes and extreme weather conditions.

**Problem Statement**
   - JPace Construction faces a tight 52-week deadline, with severe penalties for delays. Four proposals were evaluated to determine the best strategy for minimizing risks, managing costs, and ensuring timely project completion.

**Key Findings**
  - Proposal 3 (Expediting seat gallery supports) is the most effective choice, offering a balance of cost efficiency, risk mitigation, and timeline improvements.
  - This approach reduces potential penalties in case of a strike and ensures critical tasks are completed before winter, avoiding additional heating costs.
  - Contingency plans are essential to address uncertainties such as material cost fluctuations, labor strikes, and extreme weather events.

**Recommendation**
  - JPace Construction should proceed with Proposal 3, while closely monitoring risks and maintaining effective communication with stakeholders to ensure the project's success.
